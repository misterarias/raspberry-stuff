# Raspberry as a Proxy

## What's here?

I explain how to set a Raspberry pi as a proxy for something that is served in it, in this case a [motion][motion_url] server.

I will also explain how to properly secure this, using:
* a [Let's Encrypt][lets_encrypt_url] SSL certificate
* Basic user and password
* And security through obfuscation.
